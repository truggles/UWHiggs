% >> Date
% The date is in yyyy/mm/dd format. Today has been
% redefined to match, but if the date needs to be fixed, please write it in this fashion.
% For papers and PAS, \today is taken as the date the head file (this one) was last modified according to svn: see the RCS Id string above.
% For the final version it is best to "touch" the head file to make sure it has the latest date.
\date{\today}

% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
Results of a search for a neutral pseudo-scalar Higgs boson (A) decaying to a Z boson and an SM-like Higgs boson (h) in the pp collision data recorded by CMS in 2012 are presented. The analysis targets final states where the SM-like Higgs boson decays to a pair of tau leptons, and the Z boson to a pair of light leptons. The search is performed in the context of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.7 $fb^{-1}$ recorded at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy. No excess is found and upper limits at 95\% confidence limit are set on the A production cross-section in the mass range 220 $<$ $m_{A}$ $<$ 350 GeV.

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
