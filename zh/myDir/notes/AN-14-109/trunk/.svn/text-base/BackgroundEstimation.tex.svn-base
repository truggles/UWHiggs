\section{Background estimation}
\label{section:bkg}

Background to A$\rightarrow$ Zh search can be divided into two components that contribute roughly in equal proportions: irreducible and reducible backgrounds.
The next paragraphs present how these backgrounds are estimated in the analysis.

\subsection{Irreducible background}

The predominant source of irreducible background is ZZ diboson production.
The process yields exactly the same final states as the expected signal.
Both qqZZ and GluGluZZ production modes are taken into account  and their contribution are directly estimated from MC (NNLO).

Another significant source of irreducible background in this analysis is SM h associated production with a Z boson. In this process, an off-shell Z radiates a SM h boson. When the Z decays to light leptons and the h decays to $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, the final states are indistinguishable from signal events. h to WW associated with a Z boson is also considered as an irreducible background; it mainly contributes to $e\mu$  final state. 
Triboson WWZ/WZZ/ZZZ production is also considered as irreducible background. 
Finally, ttZ, where one Z decays into an electron or a muon pair,
and both top quarks decay leptonically (to $e$, $\mu$ or $\tau$) with an additional b--jet, though small thanks to the b--jet veto,
also contributes to the irreducible background.
All these processes are regrouped under the "rare" appellation.


\subsection{Reducible background}
\label{sec:red_bckgrd}

The primary source of reducible background in final states with two hadronic taus is Z+jets, while another 
significant source is SM WZ+jets production in other final states with three or more light leptons. 
In $ll\tau_h\tau_h$ final states, the reducible background is essentially composed of Z+jets events with a least two jets, whereas in 
$lle\tau_h$ and $ll\mu\tau_h$ final states, the main contribution to the reducible background comes from WZ+jets with 3 light leptons.
Fig.~\ref{fig:composition} naively shows these contributions by applying the selection to corresponding MC samples, without uncertainties or corrections related to the jet to lepton fake rates.
In both processes, one or more jets are misidentified as leptons. 
The contribution from these processes to the final selected events is estimated using a data-driven fake rate scheme.

 final states. The selection is similar as explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:eventSelection}, but the taus have the same sign and are anti-isolated, while there is no cut on their scalar \PT sum.

\label{fig:composition}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The probability of a jet faking a lepton, the "fake rate", is measured in a signal--free region. 
In this region, events are required to pass all the final state selections, except that the reconstructed tau candidates are required to have the same sign.
This effectively eliminates any possible signal while maintaining roughly the same proportion of reducible background events.

\subsubsection{Jet $\to e$ and jet $\to \mu$ fake rates}

Electron (muon) fake rates are measured using $e\tau_{h}$ $(\mu\tau_{h})$ final states. 
Electron (muon) candidates are selected as outlined in Section \ref{sec:eventSelection} for the $e\tau_{h}$ $(\mu\tau_{h})$ final states, 
with the following exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item No isolation requirement;
  \item No identification (Section~\ref{sec:loose_el_id});
  \item No cut on the scalar p$_{T}$ sum;
  \item Electron (muon) and tau have the same sign;
  \item Transverse mass between the electron (muon) and the missing transverse energy $<$ 30 GeV to suppress real leptons from WZ and ZZ.
\end{itemize}

Events that pass these selections define the "denominator" region. 
Electrons (muons) that also pass the identification and isolation requirements are included in the "numerator" region". 
The fake rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of events in the numerator region to the number of events in the denominator region. 
The fake rate is measured for ranging values of the closest jet p$_{T}$, then fitted with the sum of a constant and a falling exponential, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:emuFR}. 
The best-fit exponential function is used to estimate the fake rate, $F(jet p_{T})$ for a given data event.

\label{fig:emuFR}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Jet $\to \tau_{had}$ fake rate measurement in $ll + \tau_h\tau_h$ final states}

The hadronic tau fake rate is measured from the $\tau_{h}\tau_{h}$ channels. 
The selections are the same as those outlined in Section \ref{section:eventSelection}, 
with the exception that the cut on the scalar p$_{T}$ sum has been reduced to 50 GeV. 
The fake rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of events that pass all selections to the number of events that 
pass all selections other than isolation.
As is done for electrons and muons, this fake rate is measured for various bins of closest jet p$_{T}$, then fitted with the sum of a constant and a falling exponential. 
Two fits are performed, depending on whether the tau is reconstructed in the barrel ($|\eta|<1.4$) or endcap ($|\eta|>1.4$) of the detector, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tauLTFR}.
Whereas the agreement between data and fitted function at high $p_T$ in the barrel is less good, this is well compatible within the large statistical uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Jet $\to \tau_{had}$ fake rate measurement in $ll + l\tau_h$ final states}

The hadronic tau fake rate is measured from the $\mu\tau_{h}$ and $e\tau_h$ channels. 
The selections are the same as those outlined in Section \ref{section:eventSelection}, 
with the exception that the tau isolation has not been applied. 
The fake rate is calculated as the ratio of the number of events that pass all selections to the number of events that 
pass all selections other than isolation.
This fake rate is measured for various bins of closest jet p$_{T}$, then fitted with a falling exponential. 
Two fits are performed, depending on whether the tau is reconstructed in the barrel ($|\eta|<1.4$) or endcap ($|\eta|>1.4$) of the detector, see Fig.~\ref{fig:tauTTFR}.

\subsubsection{Reducible background normalization}

Data events are split into the three following categories and assigned the following weights:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Category 0. Events that fail isolation or identification requirements on both tau candidate legs. This category is dominated by Z+jets. These events are assigned the weight
  \begin{equation}
  F(\tau_{1})F(\tau_{2}) / (1 - F(\tau_{1}))(1 - F(\tau_{2}))
  \end{equation}

  \item Category 1. Events that fail isolation or identification requirements on the first tau (the higher p$_{T}$ tau in $\tau\tau$ events, the electron in $e\mu$ events, and the electron (muon) in $e\tau (\mu\tau)$ events) but pass for the second tau. This category includes Z+jets and a part WZ+jets events. These events are assigned the weight
  \begin{equation}
  F(\tau_{1}) / (1 - F(\tau_{1}))
  \end{equation}

  \item Category 2. Events that pass selections for the first tau but fail isolation or identification for the second tau. This category includes Z+jets and the seond part of WZ+jets events. The events are assigned the weight
  \begin{equation}
  F(\tau_{2}) / (1 - F(\tau_{2}))
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The reducible background yield is estimated as the weighted sum of categories 1 and 2 with category 0 subtracted. 
This combination of categories avoids double-counting of events with more than one fake tau. 
Table~\ref{tab:cqdata0} shows the contributions to the reducible background from each category split by channel.

\label{tab:cqdata0}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Reducible background shape}

The reducible background shape is obtained from a signal--free region where the tau candidates have the same charge.
In order to obtain smooth templates, the isolation and identification conditions on the leptons are relaxed. 
The requirements in each final state are listed here below:
\begin{itemize}
\item $lle\mu$: Loose Muon ID, muon relative isolation $< 2.0$ (no ID or isolation requirement on the electron except those of the electron candidates used to estimate the electron fake rate);
\item $lle\tau_h$: raw MVA2 tau isolation $> -0.95$, Loose electron ID, relative electron isolation $<0.3$;
\item $ll\mu\tau_h$: raw MVA2 tau isolation $> -0.95$, Loose muon ID, relative muon isolation $<0.7$;
\item $ll\tau_h\tau_h$: raw MVA2 tau isolation $> -0.95$.
\end{itemize}

These requirements have been chosen in such a way as to increase the statistics while keeping a constant composition of the reducible background. It has 
been shown, using a simulated $WZ\to 3l\nu$ MC sample, that the WZ contribution is well included in the reducible background. In particular, the high MET shape of the reducible bacground, coming essentially from WZ+jets events, is well described with these relaxing criteria.

In addition, the LT cut is relaxed to 50 GeV for the fully hadronic final state, whereas it is kept the same as in the final selection for the other final states.


\subsubsection{Reducible background shape cross-check}
The shape of the reducible background is extracted from a same-sign region with loosened isolation to increase the statistics and obtain a smooth template. 
It can be shown that, within the uncertainties,
 the shapes obtained from this signal--free region are compatible with the shapes extracted by weighting the events 
with non isolated/identified leptons with the fake rate method. Fig.~\ref{fig:redShapes} compares the shapes obtained with both techniques in different final states.

\caption[dummy text]{Reducible background shapes obtained with the fake rate method (green) or from the SS relaxed region, in four 
different final states. Within the uncertainties, both methods give compatible shapes. Because the templates are smoother, 
the shapes are estimated from a SS relaxed region.
