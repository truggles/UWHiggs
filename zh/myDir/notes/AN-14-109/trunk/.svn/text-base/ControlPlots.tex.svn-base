\section{Control plots}
\label{sec:controlPlots}


This section presents some background distributions in control regions. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:SS} shows the mass plots when the selection is the same as in Sec.~\ref{sec:eventSelection}, except that the two taus 
are required to have the same charge. This region is dominated by reducible background. Within the limited statistics, the data agrees 
well with the predictions.

In order to increase the statistics, the previous plots can be reproduced by relaxing some cuts: the $L_T$ cuts are removed in all final 
states and the tau isolation in $ll\tau_h\tau_h$ final states is relaxed from Medium to Loose. The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SSloose}.

A way to check the estimation of the reducible background in the SS region is to relax the tau isolation. A much looser isolation 
working point is chosen: MVA identification with lifetime information very loose. The prediction from the fake rate method is shown by the 
blue solid line, while predictions from Monte Carlo, which are very limited statistically, are also illustrated. The fake rate method gives 
a good agreement with data in $ll\tau_h\tau_h$, whereas the agreement is reasonable in the less populated $lle\tau_h$ final states, see Fig.~\ref{fig:SSMVAvL}.

The Monte Carlo estimation of ZZ diboson production can be checked in $llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ events. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ZZ}, 
the ZZ prediction described data well in those two final states.
