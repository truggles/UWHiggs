\section {Event selection}
\label{sec:eventSelection}

Eight final states are analyzed, according to the decay mode of the Z boson, and to the decay mode of the taus 
originating from the h boson. 

The  Z boson consists of a pair of well identified and isolated light leptons ($\mu$ or $e$), which are expected to fire the trigger.
The h boson is reconstructed from two taus; leptonic and hadronic decays of taus are considered. 

The first step consists in selecting a same-flavour light lepton pair to reconstruct the Z boson, and then identifying the two taus from the h boson.

Details about the event selection follow.


\subsection{Z boson selection}
 The  Z boson candidate is reconstructed from two same-flavour light leptons of opposite charge, satisfying the criteria described below. If 
more than one combination of same-flavour light leptons exist, the one with the invariant mass closest to the Z mass is chosen.

\paragraph*{\large $Z \rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ \\}
The characteristics of the two muons selected to form a Z candidate are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Opposite--charge;
\item Global and tracker muons passing Particle Flow identification;
\item $p_{T} > 20 (10)$\GeV for the leading (subleading) muon, $|\eta| < 2.4$; 
\item Combined PF Relative Isolation $\Delta \beta $ corrected $ < 0.30$;
\item Invariant mass of the two muons between $60$ and $120$ GeV.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{\large $Z \rightarrow e^+ e^-$ \\}
The characteristics of the two muons selected to form a Z candidate are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Opposite--charge;
\item "Very loose" identification working point;
\item $p_{T} > 20(10)$\GeVc for the leading (subleading) electron, $|\eta| < 2.5$;
\item Not more than one missing inner tracker hit for each electron;
\item Combined PF Relative Isolation $\Delta \beta $ corrected $ < 0.30$;
\item Invariant mass of the two electrons between $60$ and $120$ GeV.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{h boson  Selection}

After having selected two light leptons to form a Z candidate, the h candidate is reconstructed from two additional leptons. 

A cut on the scalar pT sum of h legs, $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$, is applied to lower the reducible background as well as the irreducible 
background from ZZ diboson production. The thresholds of this cut depend on the final state and have been chosen 
in such a way as to optimize the sensitivity of the analysis to the presence of an $A \to Zh$ signal for A masses between 220 and 350 GeV. 

 
\paragraph*{\large $h \rightarrow \mu\tau_{had}$ \\}

In this mode one tau from the h boson decays hadronically while the other decays leptonically to a muon plus neutrinos.
The presence of the muon makes this channel relatively clean but small background remains from
Z+jets or WZ+jets events, where a Z decays into a pair of electrons or muons, an additional real muon comes from
either a $b$ jet or a W boson and, finally, a jet fakes the hadronic $\tau$. The following
selection is applied:

\begin{itemize}
\item One loosely identified muon with $p_{T} >$ 10 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$, passing relative isolation $ < 0.30$;
\item One hadronic tau with transverse momentum greater than 21 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.3$, passing ``decay mode finding'', ``against muon 2 tight'' and ``against electron loose'' discriminators, and satisfying the ``loose Combined 3 Hits isolation'' conditions;
\item Charge of the muon and tau must be opposite;
\item $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h} > $ 45 GeV.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{\large $ h \rightarrow e\tau_{had}$ \\}
In this mode one tau from the h boson decays hadronically while the other decays leptonically to an electron plus neutrinos.
These channels are expected to have more backgrounds from Z+jets or WZ+jets than
 the $\mu\tau$ channels since a charged pion or a photon may also fake the electron.
The following selection is applied:

\begin{itemize}
\item One tightly identified electron with $p_{T} >$ 10 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$, with no missing inner tracker hits, and having a relative isolation $ < 0.3$;
\item One tau with transverse momentum greater than 21 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.3$, passing ``decay mode finding'', ``against muon 2 loose'' and ``against electron tight MVA'' discriminators, and satisfying the ``loose Combined 3 Hits'' isolation crieria;
\item Charge of the electron and tau must be opposite;
\item $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h} > $ 30 GeV.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{\large $h \rightarrow \tau_{had}\tau_{had}$ \\}
In this mode both taus from h decay hadronically.

This mode has the largest background due to hadronic jets being reconstructed as taus.
The main background source is Z production in
association with two or more jets.  
The following cuts are applied:

\begin{itemize}
\item Two opposite--charge $\tau$ with $p_T >$ 21 GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.3;
\item Taus pass ``decay mode finding'' discriminator, ``against muon 2 loose'' working point, ``against electron loose'' working point;
\item $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h} > $ 70 GeV.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{\large $h \rightarrow e\mu$ \\}
This channel is clean but has the lowest branching ratio in $h \rightarrow \tau\tau$ decay.
The following cuts are applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item One loosely identified  muon with $p_{T} >$ 10 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$;
\item One loosely identified  electron with $p_{T} >$ 10 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.5$, with no more than 1 missing inner tracker hit;
\item Combined PF Relative Isolation $\Delta \beta $ corrected for muon and electron $ < 0.30$;
\item The charge of the electron and the muon must be opposite;
\item $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h} > $ 25 GeV.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{$L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$ cut optimization}
$L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$ represents the scalar \PT sum of the leptons originating from the h boson. Its distribution significantly differs 
between the signal and the backgrounds (reducible as well as irreducible) as shown in 
Fig~\ref{fig:lt}, which permits to increase the $S/\sqrt{B}$ ratio by cutting on it.
Special emphasis should be given to optimizing the $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$ thresholds depending on the h final state. The thresholds minimizing the expected limits at most A masses are chosen. It can be shown, as in Fig~\ref{fig:LTopti}, that the optimal thresholds are exactly the same as those defined 
in the SM ZH analysis. This result is expected because of the very similar $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$ shapes for MSSM $A\to Zh$ and SM ZH processes (Fig.~\ref{fig:lt}). As presented in the paragraphs here-above, $L_{\rm T}^{\rm h}$ thresholds of 25, 35, 45 and 70 GeV are chosen in $lle\mu$, $lle\tau_h$, $ll\mu\tau_h$ and $ll\tau_h\tau_h$ final states respectively.

\subsection{Additional requirements}
Some common cuts are applied to all final states. 
To remove $t\bar{t}$ background, the event should not contain any b-jet with $p_{T} >$ 20 GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$, bDiscriminator('combinedSecondaryVertexBJetTags') $>$ 0.679. 
A 1\% yield uncertainty due to the b-jet veto is considered (see Sec.~\ref{sec:Systematic}).

Events that contain more well identified and isolated electrons and muons than expected in the considered final state are vetoed. A well-identified and isolated electron is defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \PT $>$ 10 GeV, $|\eta|<$ 2.5;
\item relative isolation $<$ 0.3;
\item very loose MVA electron identification,
\end{itemize}
while well-identified and isolated muons are defined as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \PT $>$ 10 GeV, $|\eta|<$ 2.4;
\item relative isolation $<$ 0.3;
\item loose muon identification.
\end{itemize}
This extra lepton veto ensures that there is no event overlap between the different categories. It may be worth noticing that there is no condition 
on extra identified and isolated taus in the events.

All four objects are further required to be separated from each other by \DR\ larger than 0.5, 
and to come from the same primary vertex ($\Delta z < $ 0.1 cm). Some cleaning conditions are applied to the objects: electrons are required not to
overlap with any well identified and isolated muon (as defined above) within \DR $<$ 0.1, while taus are required not to overlap with 
any well identified and identified muon
or any well identified and isolated electron within \DR $<$ 0.1. Furthermore, b-jets are also required 
not to overlap with 
any well identified and identified muon
or any well identified and isolated electron within \DR $<$ 0.4.
