\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
In the Yang-Mills theory of weak physics, all the gauge bosons are required to be massless. 
However, it was clear experimentally that the masses of the weak force mediators (W$^{+/-}$, Z) are on the order of 80 GeV. 
The process of electroweak symmetry breaking was proposed in order to provide mass to the weak force mediators. 
This theory introduces a new complex doublet. Through the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the degrees of freedom in this complex doublet 
are reduced from four to one. This remaining degree of freedom corresponds to a new scalar field with a non-zero vacuum expectation value, the Higgs field. 
The Higgs field implied the existence of new particle, the Higgs boson, which is an excitation of the Higgs field. 
However, the mass of the Higgs boson is an unspecified parameter in the theory.  
Since its proposal, experimental physicists have been searching for evidence of a Higgs boson. 
Until very recently, however, the particle remained elusive.

On July 4, 2012 the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the LHC confirmed the observation of a standard model Higgs-like boson with a mass of about 125 GeV \cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa}. 

Supersymmetry provides an elegant and simple solution to many open questions in particle physics, such as the unification of coupling constants or the hierarchy problem. 
The supersymmetric model predicts the existence of a bosonic superpartner for each standard model fermion 
and a fermionic superpartner for each standard model boson. 
This new symmetry of nature effectively doubles the number of particles in the universe. If this symmetry were unbroken, each standard model particle would have a superpartner with the same mass. If this were the case, however, supersymmetric particles would have been discovered long ago. It is therefore necessary that supersymmetry is a broken symmetry. Unfortunately, this makes the masses of the supersymmetric particles unspecified. There are compelling arguments, however, that suggest that the lightest supersymmetric particles should have masses on the 1 TeV scale \cite{Haber:1993wf}. For this reason, many physicists expect to experimentally observe signs of supersymmetric particles during LHC runs.

The most basic extension of the standard model that includes supersymmetry is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). 
MSSM requires the existence of two complex scalar Higgs fields. This leads to two neutral CP-even Higgs particles, h and H, 
a CP-odd Higgs particle A, and two charged and CP-even Higgs particles, H$^{+}$ and H$^{-}$. 
The masses of these five Higgs particles can be specified by two independent parameters, the mass of the A and tan$\beta$, defined as: 

\begin{equation}
tan\beta = v_{1}/v_{2}
\end{equation}

where v$_{1}$ and v$_{2}$ are the vacuum expectation values for the neutral component of the Higgs field which couples to up and down quarks,
 respectively \cite{Haber:1993wf}. 
MSSM predicts that the decay of the A into a Z boson and h has a relatively high branching fraction in the mass range between 260 GeV and 340 GeV. For an A mass less than 260 GeV, the A predominately decays to neutralinos. For an A mass greater than 340 GeV, A decay is dominated by $t\bar{t}$. Therefore, it is convenient to probe this mass range using the A $\rightarrow$ Zh mode. A masses between 220 and 350 GeV are probed in this analysis.


The presence of the light leptons orginating from the Z boson helps isolating the signal from standard model backgrounds. The highest sensitivity to $A\toZh$ signal is therefore achieved for $h$ final states with large branching ratios. Limits on $A \to Zh \to llbb$ have been set in~\cite{CMS_AN_2013-302}.
The present analysis searches for an A which decays to a Z and an h, where the Z boson decays to $e^{+}e^{-}$ or $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ 
and the Higgs boson decays to $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$. The methodology of this analysis is very similar to the search for standard model Higgs associated 
production with a Z boson using tau final states \cite{Chatrchyan:2014nva}.
