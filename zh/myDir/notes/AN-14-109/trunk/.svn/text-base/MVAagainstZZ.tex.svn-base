\section{MVA rejection of ZZ irreducible background}
\label{sec:MVAagainstZZ}

ZZ diboson production is an irreducible background because, as is the case for the signal, it can result in four real 
leptons in the final state. In the analysis presented here, it is reduced by a cut on the scalar \PT sum of the taus originating from the h boson. 
However there are many more handles that permit to discriminate it from the signal $A\to Zh\to ll\tau\tau$. These discriminating 
variables may be combined in a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) to enhance the ZZ/signal discrimination.

Twelve powerful variables have been identified, and are listed here by order of discriminative potential:
\begin{itemize}
\item ST, the scalar \PT sum of all four leptons and MET;
\item $\DeltaR(\tau,\tau)$, the distance in the ($\eta,\phi$) plane between the two taus;
\item A centrality, the ratio between the vectorial \PT sum of the reconstructed h and Z bosons, and their scalar sum;
\item $\DeltaR(Z,h)$, the distance in the ($\eta,\phi$) plane between the reconstructed Z and h boson;
\item $LT^Z$, the scalar \PT sum of the leptons originating from the reconstructed Z boson;
\item $\cos \theta_1$, the angle between the negatively charged lepton from the Z and the Z flight direction in the Z rest frame;
\item h centrality, the ratio between the vectorial \PT sum of the reconstructed taus, and their scalar sum;
\item twist(Z,h), $\atan \Delta\phi(Z,h) / \atan \Delta \eta(Z,h)$;
\item h \PT;
\item $\cos \theta^*$, the angle between the Z flight direction and the beam axis, in the A rest frame;
\item A \PT;
\item twist($\tau_1,\tau_2$), $\atan \Delta\phi(\tau_1,\tau_2) / \atan \Delta \eta(\tau_1,\tau_2)$.
\end{itemize}

The BDT is trained with a mix of signal events with A masses between 290 and 350 GeV. The distributions of the above-mentioned 
variables are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:bdt_var} for signal (blue) and ZZ (red). 
The BDT output distributions as well as the ROC curve are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:bdt_out}.

Even if cutting on the BDT output has been proven efficient to reduce not only ZZ but also the reducible background, 
this MVA method has not been used to produce the final results exposed in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}. 
The main reason is the lack of statistics in the signal region; the level of control of the backgrouns, especially the reducible one, 
has not been judged sufficient because of the small number of events. However, the estimated gain of such a method is superior to 20\%, and
 could be used in future runs with larger luminosity.
