\section{$llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ final states}
\label{sec:otherChannels}

Six di-tau final states are possible: $\tau_h\tau_h$, $e\tau_h$, $\mu\tau_h$, $e\mu$, $ee$ and $\mu\mu$.
The first four have been analyzed in this search for $A\to Zh$. Historically, $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ were not considered 
in the SM ZH analysis because of the overlap with $H\toZZ\to4l$ analysis. The potential of these two channels 
has been evaluated in the context of $A\toZh$ analysis.

Similarly as is the case for $lle\mu$ final states, the contribution from reducible backgrounds is small in $llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ channels.
However ZZ diboson contribution is strongly enhanced because it is impossible to discriminate electrons from Z decays, from electrons from tau decays. 
A useful handle to reduce the ZZ irreducible background in these final states is the transverse missing energy. Indeed, 
$ZZ\to llll$ events are not supposed to contain a large MET, whereas four neutrinos are produced in the searched $A\to Zh\to llll$ decay. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:met_eemm} illustrates the MET distribution in signal and background events. A threshold of 30 GeV has been chosen 
for all $llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ channels, which is a compromise between the signal acceptance at low mass and the ZZ reduction.

The final plots for $llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ final states are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eemm_plots}. As expected, the background 
is dominated by ZZ diboson production, in larger quantities than for $lle\mu$ final states. The corresponding expected limits, compared 
to the other channels, are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:eemm_limits}, while the improvement in the combined limit obtained by adding the 
four extra channels is shown in the right-hand side of the same figure. The limits in $llee$ and $ll\mu\mu$ final states are much worse than 
those of the other channels, especially at low mass, which is due to the MET cut. The general improvement in combined limit is less than 5\%, 
which justifies the fact that these channels have not been treated in the core analysis.

Since the general improvement is anyway small at low mass, a higher MET cut can be applied to enhance the limit at high mass.
With a 50 GeV cut, the limit gets up to 10\% tighter at high A mass, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:eemm_limits50}.
