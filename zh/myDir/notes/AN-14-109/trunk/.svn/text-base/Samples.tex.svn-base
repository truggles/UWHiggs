\section{Data and simulations}
\label{section:samples}

\subsection{Samples}
The search is performed using the DoubleElectron and DoubleMuon primary datasets
collected by CMS in 2012, at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$.
The analysed datasets are detailed in Tab.~\ref{tab:data_samples_ZH}.

The trigger paths used in this analysis are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mu17\_Mu8
\item Mu17\_TkMu8
\item Ele17\_CaloIdT\_CaloIsoVL\_TrkIdVL\_TrkIsoVL\_Ele8\_CaloIdT\_CaloIsoVL\_TrkIdVL\_TrkIsoVL
\end{itemize}

Signal as well as ZZ diboson production and triboson WZZ, WWZ and ZZZ production, are generated with \MADGRAPH~\cite{Alwall:2011uj}.
The $\tau$--lepton decays are simulated with \TAUOLA~\cite{Jadach:1993hs}, which includes spin effects.
Table~\ref{tab:MCsamples} shows the MC samples and their cross section times branching
ratios production for signal and backgrounds. Signal cross-sections at different masses are not mentioned in this table,
 because the results presented in this note focus on a model-independent search, and because, in the MSSM, cross-sections also depend 
on $\tan\beta$. However, Fig.~\ref{fig:xsAZh} illustrates the A production cross-section in gluon fusion 
and associated production, as well as $A\rightarrow Zh$ branching ratio predicted by FeynHiggs in the $m_h^{max}$ MSSM scenario.

Minimum bias events generated by PYTHIA are added to all generated Monte Carlo samples
according to the "S10" pile-up profile described in~\cite{S10PileUpProfile}, using the tools described in~\cite{genPileUpReweighting}. 
The pile-up expected in data
is computed based on instantaneous luminosity and the pp inelastic cross-section. 
Simulated events are passed through the full GEANT~\cite{geant} based simulation of the CMS apparatus and
are reconstructed using the same version of the CMS event reconstruction software as the data.

\subsection{Comparison between Pythia and MadGraph signal samples}

MadGraph signal samples have been used in this analysis, but Pythia samples have also been generated.
It can be brought out that the Z spin is not correctly handled by Pythia, which results in a non-defined polarization state.
This difference affects variables such as $\cos\theta_1$, the angle 
between the negatively charged lepton from the Z and the Z flight direction in the Z rest frame,
and the lepton transverse momenta, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:costh}. In particular, the \PT of the subleading lepton from the Z is harder when 
simulated by Madgraph. This results in a higher signal acceptance for MadGraph samples, and a limit exclusion approximately 
10\% tighter.

\subsection{Comparison between Pythia and Madgraph ZZ diboson samples}

In order to be consistent with the choice of signal samples, the ZZ diboson sample generated with MadGraph has been used in this analysis. 
The tau \PT spectra as well as the $m_A$ distribution are very similar with those obtained from the Pythia sample, see Fig.~\ref{fig:compaZZ}, while the normalizations 
are compatible with each other when a cross-section of 0.187 pb is used for the MadGraph sample and 0.130 pb for the Pythia sample.
