\section{Scale factors and event-by-event weights}
\label{section:sf}

\subsection{Trigger efficiency}
To compensate the difference in trigger efficiency between data and MC, both data and MC
 trigger efficiencies are fitted with a Crystalball function and the scale factor is obtained by
 dividing these two functions.

\subsection{Lepton identification and isolation efficiency}

Scale factors are applied to correct the difference in efficiency between the identification and
isolation of electrons and muons between data and MC. 

\subsection{Pileup reweighting}

Simulated events are reweighted to account for the difference in the distribution of reconstructed vertices between data and MC.
